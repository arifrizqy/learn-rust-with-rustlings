# Learn Rust with Rustlings

A hands-on journey to learning Rust through the official [Rustlings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings) exercises.

This repository contains my personal progress and solutions as I explore the Rust programming language using the Rustlings exercises. Rustlings provides a practical, code-first approach to learning core Rust concepts like ownership, borrowing, lifetimes, traits, enums, and more.

Each exercise is solved step by step, with attention to understanding the "why" behind the code ‚Äî not just the syntax.
